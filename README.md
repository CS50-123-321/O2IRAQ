# O2-IRAQ
The problem:
Iraqi community lacks awareness in terms of climate change. We have seen a well-noticed ignorance of the environment from the individuals, stakeholders, and ORGs. Not only that, but there is no specific platform that is interested in educating individuals about the importance of protecting the environment. As a result, the Iraqi citizens are negatively affected by the current climate change crisis. 

The proposed solution:
O2IRAQ is a platform that focuses fundamentally on climate change in IRAQ. It is a new space for everyone to discuss environmental issues happening in our region. O2IRAQ aims to build an educated audience about the significance the climate change and its impacts on human-being life.
